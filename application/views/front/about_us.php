                        </div>
                        <p>I have been in Safety my entire career. In those 27 years I have worked for the following companies; General Electric, Emerson Electric in Ithaca, NY, Link-Belt, and finished up at Dayton Power and Light.</p>
                        <p>In June of 2018 the company I was working for closed its doors permanently which left me an unemployed safety professional in need of work. This is where the idea for SafetyEngagement.com was born. </p>
                        <p>My wife is a  3rd  grade teacher and I had moved her from Bloomington, In to Ithaca NY to finally Maysville, KY in pursuit of my own career.  She now has 6 years until she can retire with 20 years in the KY school system. In order to see her career out here in KY I was limited on employment options.  </p>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-12">
                     <div class="our_about_left_content">
                        <p>My options were either I could interview and work for another company locally,  I could interview and work for a staffing company, or I could go out on my own and be a safety consultant.  Being a Safety Consultant was most appealing.  I could set my own hours, do the work I wanted to do and finally work from my house; which would be nice.  But the reality set-in…  Who can I help?  Who needs a safety project completed? Where can I find this information? How do I market myself to let companies know I’m ready to help?  How much do I charge?  Do I need insurance?  There were so many questions and a huge lack of answers. </p>
                        <p>Then I stated to think… there must be a website online for people like me and with questions like mine but to my amazement I could not find anything out there! Sure, there were companies who were advertising their services and there are plenty of staffing companies but they are just looking for their own work for their companies.  No one that I know of has a way to post and bid safety jobs. </p>
                        <p>So in March of 2017 I started Safety Engagement… my goal was to make it easy for safety professionals to find work and easy for companies to find qualified safety professionals. Sounds like an easy concept right? Well, 1.5 years later we are just now in the final steps to launch the site. In order to make sure everything is perfect, the time needed has been spent in every step of the way to ensure that safety professionals and companies will have a stress-free, paper free way of posting and bidding on short-term, contracted safety jobs.   </p>
                        <p>This is not a staffing company and it is not a recruiting company.  We simply give everyone in the country who needs a safety job completed a place to post that job.  </p>
                        <p>I’m going to be just like you, I’m going to bid on jobs and potentially post jobs.  I want all Safety Professionals to have the option to create their own future, work from home, work as much or as little as they want, and to be able to create work on their own terms.  </p>
                        <p>I hope you find safety freedom and many employment opportunities here at Safety Engagement. Thank you! </p>
