			<h3 class="title">My Story</h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-330 alignleft" src="https://www.safetyengagement.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bill_OMara.png" alt="" width="179" height="224">I have been in Safety my entire career.&nbsp; I started with General Electric while finishing classes at Indiana University.&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked for GE for 5 years.&nbsp; While there I developed a good relationship with a manager who took the plant manager’s job at Emerson in Ithaca, NY.&nbsp; This was my first opportunity to be a safety manager at a plant.&nbsp; Eight years later I was promoted to Safety Manager – Drives and Components in Maysville, Ky.&nbsp; Eventually the Emerson business left town and I went to work for Link-Belt for 2.5 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, I am currently employed at Dayton Power and Light.</p>
<p>The reason I started SafetyEngagement is my plant will be <strong><u>shutting its doors in June of 2018</u></strong>.&nbsp; My wife is a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade teacher and I had moved her from Bloomington, In to Ithaca NY to finally Maysville, KY.&nbsp; She has 6 years until she can retire with 20 years in the KY school system.&nbsp; So, I was limited on employment options.&nbsp; My thoughts were that I could interview and work for another company, I could interview and work for a staffing company or I could go out on my own and be a safety consultant.&nbsp; Being a Safety Consultant was most appealing.&nbsp; I could set my own hours, do the work I wanted to do and finally work from my house; which would be nice.&nbsp; But the reality set-in…&nbsp; Who can I help?&nbsp; Who needs a safety project completed?&nbsp; How do I advertise to let companies know I’m ready to help?&nbsp; How much do I charge?&nbsp; Do I need insurance?&nbsp; There were so many questions.</p>
<p>Then I got the idea, maybe there is a website that allows companies to post jobs and safety professionals to bid on those jobs.&nbsp; My eureka moment…&nbsp; but to my amazement I couldn’t find anything out there.&nbsp; Sure, there were companies who were advertising their services.&nbsp; There are plenty of staffing companies but they are just looking for their own work for their companies.&nbsp; No one that I know of has a way to post and bid safety jobs.&nbsp; Now we do.</p>
<p>So in March of 2017 I started SafetyEngagement… my goal was to make it easy for safety professionals to find work and easy for companies to find solid qualified safety professionals.&nbsp; Sounds like an easy concept?&nbsp; Well, almost a year later I’m in the final steps to launch the site.&nbsp; I’m taking the time needed so that safety professionals and companies will have a stress free, paper free way of posting and bidding on jobs, temporary jobs.&nbsp; This is not a staffing company and it’s not a recruiting company.&nbsp; We simply give everyone in the country who needs a job completed in the safety world a place to post that job.</p>
<p>I’m going to be just like you, I’m going to bid on jobs and potentially post jobs.&nbsp; I want all Safety Professionals to have the option to create their own future, work from home, work as much or as little as they want.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Create work on their own terms.</em></p>
